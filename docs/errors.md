ANTLR errors arise from issues in the parser’s ability to match input tokens to the grammar rules defined. Here's a breakdown of each error, including which ones may be critical enough to halt parsing.

### 1. **Mismatched Input**
   - **Description**: This occurs when ANTLR encounters an input token that does not match the expected token as per the grammar. For example, if the parser expects a keyword like `IF` but finds another token, like `WHILE`, this error will trigger.
   - **Severity**: Moderate. ANTLR attempts to recover from mismatches by skipping or substituting tokens. However, if mismatched input occurs in critical parts of a parse (e.g., near structural keywords like `BEGIN` or `END`), it can lead to incomplete or incorrect parsing.
   - **Impact**: The parser can often continue, but downstream interpretations may be affected if critical tokens are missed or misinterpreted.

### 2. **Missing**
   - **Description**: This error means ANTLR expected a specific token but found it missing. For instance, if a semicolon is missing at the end of a statement where the grammar requires one, a "missing" error will appear.
   - **Severity**: Moderate. Missing token errors are typically recoverable, as ANTLR can insert a “phantom” token in the parsing process to proceed with the input.
   - **Impact**: In many cases, parsing will continue. However, missing tokens can lead to incorrect parse trees, potentially complicating downstream processing if they occur at structural points.

### 3. **No Viable Alternative at Input**
   - **Description**: This error indicates that the parser encountered an input segment where no rule could match the tokens. It often occurs in ambiguous grammars or when an input sequence has syntax not covered by the grammar.
   - **Severity**: High. This is a critical error that suggests ANTLR cannot continue parsing as it has no viable path forward with the given input.
   - **Impact**: This type of error is often unrecoverable, and the parser may stop or significantly misinterpret the remaining input. It often leads to premature termination of parsing, as the parser cannot determine how to proceed.

### 4. **Extraneous Input**
   - **Description**: ANTLR reports an extraneous input error when it finds additional tokens where none are expected by the grammar. For instance, an extra comma or bracket might trigger this.
   - **Severity**: Low to moderate. ANTLR can handle extraneous input by discarding unexpected tokens and moving forward.
   - **Impact**: Parsing will often continue with little impact unless the extraneous input is crucial to meaning. Minor extraneous errors are commonly recoverable and don’t usually lead to stopping parsing.

### Summary: Critical Error for Parsing
Among these, **“No Viable Alternative at Input”** is the most critical error and likely to halt parsing, as it indicates that the parser cannot find a valid rule to match the input. This often leads to early termination of parsing, as there is no path forward. The other errors are generally recoverable, though they may lead to partial or incorrect parsing.
