Here’s a table explaining the various elements:

| No  | Name        | Description                                                                 | Usage                                                                                               |
|-----|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | **Lexer**    | A lexer (lexical analyzer) is responsible for breaking down the source code into tokens, which are the smallest units of meaningful text. | Used to tokenize the input source code into distinct tokens, which are then processed by the parser. |
| 2   | **Parser**   | A parser takes the tokens produced by the lexer and builds a syntax tree (AST or parse tree) based on grammar rules. | Used to analyze the token sequence and ensure the code follows the defined grammar. It creates a hierarchical structure. |
| 3   | **Listener** | A listener is a component that listens for events triggered during the parsing process, particularly when visiting nodes in the syntax tree. | Used for event-driven programming. It typically reacts to the parser’s walk through the tree, performing actions like error handling or semantic checks. |
| 4   | **Visitor**  | A visitor is similar to a listener but instead of responding to events, it explicitly visits nodes in the parse tree, allowing for custom actions. | Used for traversal of the tree, typically performing actions like interpretation, transformation, or analysis of the code. |
| 5   | **Debugger** | A debugger is a tool that helps in identifying and fixing issues in the code by allowing step-by-step execution, breakpoints, and inspection of variables. | Used to run the code in a controlled environment, pausing execution at breakpoints and inspecting the state of the program. |
| 6   | **Compiler** | A compiler translates the entire source code into machine code or an intermediate code in one go, typically producing an executable. | Used to convert high-level code into machine-level instructions or intermediate code, making it ready for execution on a target system. |
| 7   | **Interpreter** | An interpreter reads and executes the code line by line without generating a separate output file, typically translating into machine code or bytecode on the fly. | Used for executing source code directly, making it useful for dynamic execution, debugging, and educational purposes. |

These components are commonly used in the context of programming language processing, where the lexer and parser are often the first steps in processing the source code, and the listener, visitor, debugger, compiler, and interpreter follow depending on the use case and execution model.
